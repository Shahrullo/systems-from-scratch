# ðŸ§  Systems From Scratch

A collection of **projects built entirely from scratch** â€” no frameworks, no shortcuts.
Each subproject explores how core technologies actually work under the hood â€” from HTTP servers and Docker to databases, compilers, and beyond.

---

## ðŸ“š Purpose

This repository is my personal **learning and exploration lab**.
The goal is to **understand and reimplement fundamental systems and tools** that we use every day â€” focusing on:

* System design and architecture
* Networking and protocols
* Operating system fundamentals
* Containers and virtualization
* Databases and file systems

Each subfolder in this repo represents a standalone project with its own documentation, design notes, and implementation.

## ðŸ§© Projects

| Project               | Description                                                                   |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `http-from-scratch`   | HTTP server built from scratch in Golang â€” no frameworks.                   |
<!-- | `docker-from-scratch` | A simplified container runtime built using Linux namespaces and cgroups.      |
| `kv-store`            | A simple key-value store with in-memory and file-backed modes.                |
| `compiler-basics`     | Tiny compiler frontend that parses and interprets arithmetic expressions.     |
| `shell`               | A basic Unix shell that supports command parsing, pipes, and I/O redirection. | -->

## ðŸ§± Philosophy

> "The best way to understand something deeply is to build it yourself."

This repo isnâ€™t about production-ready code â€” itâ€™s about **understanding fundamentals**, **experimenting with system internals**, and **building strong mental models** of how technologies actually work.

---

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack

Most projects are implemented in:

* **Go** or **Python** â€” chosen for clarity and control
* Occasionally **C** for low-level system exploration

Each project has:

* Its own `README.md`
* Design explanation
* Example usage and tests
